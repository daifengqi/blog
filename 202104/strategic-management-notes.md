### External Environment

**General Environment**

- Demographic（人口统计学）: population size, age structure, geographic distribution, income distribution, ethnic mix
- economic: inflation rate, interest ratem trade deficits/surpluses, budget deficits/surplues, personal/business savings rate, gross domestic product（国内生产总值）
- political/legal: antitrust（反垄断） laws, taxation laws, deregulation philosophies（解除管制）, labor training laws（劳动法）, educational policies（教育政策）
- sociocultural: women in workforce, workforce diversity, attitudes about quality of work life, shifts in work and career preferences, shifts in preferences regarding product...
- technological: product innovation, applications of knowledge, RUD expenditure, communication tech
- global: political events, global market...
- Sustainable physical environment: energy consumption, renewable energy...

**Industry Environment** => [profitability]!

波特五力：

- threat of new entrants, 
- threat of product substitues,
- power of suppliers, 
- power of buyers, 
- intensity of rivalry among competitors

**Competitor Analysis**

- gather and interpret information
- understand competitor -> provide insights of general/industry environment

**External Environment Analysis**

- General: focus on the future
- Industry: focus on factors and conditions (influence a firm's profit ability)
- Competitor: focus on dynamics of {actions, responses, intentions}

**Component of Analysis (changes and trends)**

1. Scan: identify ~ early signals
2. Monitor: detect ~ meaning
3. Forecast: develop ~ projection ~ anticipated outcomes
4. Assess: determine ~ importance and timing ~ firms' strategies and management

\*opportunity (if exploited effectivelty -> help a firm achieve ...) : threat (hinder a firm's efforts to achieve ...) | strategic competitiveness

### General Environment

**demographic**

1. population size -> market size
2. age structure -> target and strategy
3. geographic distribution -> location
4. ehnic mix -> marketing strategy
5. income distribution -> pricing, product focus

**economic**

market growth rate, consumer demand, inflation and interest rate, trade deficits or surpluses, budget deficits or surpluses, personal and business savings rates（储蓄率）, gross domestic product

**legal/political**

regulation, consumer privacy laws, lobbying（游说）, antitrust and deregulation, taxation.

**sociocultural**

attitudes to {health care, qualify of worklife}, deverse aging workforce, women in workplace, concerns about environment

shifts in {work/career preferences, product/service preferences}

**technological**

product innovation, knowledge of application, growth of the Internet, communication tech

**Global**

- Important **geographical trends**
- Critical **global niche market**
- Growth of the **informal economy**
- **Different cultural and institutional attributes**

**Sustainable**

physical environment segment (emerging trends oriented to sustaining the world's physical environment; recognition of interactive influence of ecological/social/economics; substainable industry development; increased corporate social responsibility)

### Industry Environment

**definition**

1. a group of firms -> products are close substitutes
2. Competitive strategies -> pursue above-average returns
3. industry structure characteristics -> influence firm's choice strategies

**threat of new entrants: barriers to entry**

- economies of scale
- product differentiation (unique? loyalty? price?)
- capital requirement (physical facilities, inventories, ...)
- switching costs (one-time costs, psychic（精神的） costs of ending a relationship, equipment/employee)
- access to distribution channels（分销渠道） (不存在/不可靠，难以建立，建立自己的分销渠道花时间且昂贵)
- cost disadvantage independent of scale (proprietary, raw materials, location)
- government policy (license of permit, deregulation)
- existing firms' retaliation（报复/反击）

[(Poter) Economies of scale | Product differentiation | Capital requirements | Cost disadvantages independent of size | Access to distribution channels | Government policy](http://changingminds.org/disciplines/marketing/understanding_markets/barriers_entry.htm#ret)

**bargaining power of suppliers**

Increase when

- suppliers <u>large and few</u> in number
- substitutes are not available
- Individual buyers are not large but many
- goods are critical
- high switching costs
- pose a threat forward `?` 上游：自己建造

**bargaining power of buyers**

Increase when

- buyers are <u>large and few</u> in number
- a large portion of output
- a significant portion of revenues
- switching costs
- pose threat backward `?` 下沉：自己做原材料

**rivalry among competitors**

Increase when

- numerous or equally balanced
- whole industry grow slows or declines
- High fixed/storage costs 
- lack of differentiation / low switching costs
- Strategy stakes are high（战略风险高）
- high exit barriers

**threat of substitute products**

increase when

- buyers face few/low switching costs
- Substitute products's price is low
- Substitute products's quality/performance are equal/greater

<u>Differentiated industry products that are valued by customers reduce this threat.</u>

**Locate Industry**

Unattractive (low profit potential): low entry barrier | s/b have strong positions | strong substitute threats | intense rivalry among competitors

Atrractive (high profit potential): high entry barrier | s/b weak positions | few substitute threats | moderate rivalry among competitors

### Competitor Analysis

1. Future ~ objectives
2. Current ~ strategy
3. Assumption ~ belief
4. Capabilities ~ strengths & weaknesses

### Internal Organization

**Internal Analysis**

competitve advantage, Context, Creating Value(how, measure, challenge),.

**Resources => Capabilities => Core Competencies =>Competitive Advantages **

=> four criteria (value, rarity, costly-to-imitate, non-substitute)

**Value Chain Analysis**

define, primary activities, support activities, outsource

### Competitive Advantage

achieve strategic competitiveness & earn above-average returns

 -> when

​    -> core competencies

​        -> effectively {acquired, bundled, leveraged}

<u>Over time, the benefits of any value-creating strategy can be duplicated by competitors.</u>

core competence subtainability <-

1. rate of ... obsolescence
2. availability of substitutes for ...
3. Imitability of ...

Required: unique resources, capabilities, competencies

### Context of Internal Analysis

- Global economy: flow of resources throughout the global economy
- Global mind-set: not dependent on the assumptions of a single country, culture or context
- Analysis outcome: leverage the bundle of heterogeneous resources and capabilities

### Creating Value: how?

1. exploiting core competencies/competitive advantages
2. innovatively bundling and leveraging resources and capabilities

### Creating Value: measure

1. measured by product performance/attrbutes (customers pay)
2. leads to above-avarage returns

### Creating Value: Challenge

- non-routine
- high ethical implications

### Analyzing Internal Organiaztion: Challenge

- know when a capability is not a competence
- learn quickly from failures
- Maturity of judgment -> uncertainty(environment, needs), complexity(interrelationships), intra-organizational conflicts(managers decision) <- unbiased

significantly influence a.-a. returns

### Resources & Capabilities & Core Competencies

Resources(tangiable, intangiable)

​     => capabilities

​         => **core competencies**

​             => **competitive advantage**

### Resources

**assets**: people, value of brand => input of a firm's production...

1. **tangible**: financial(capability to borrow from outside, or generate from inside), physical(plant and equipment, location, distribution facilities, product inventory), technological(copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade secrets, organizational(structures)
2. **intangiable**: human(knowledge, trust, skill, collaboration), innovation(idea, scientific), reputaion(brand name, perceotion, positive reputation with suppliers and customers)

### Capabilities

Deploy resource, emerge over time, based on developing, carrying and exchanging information and knowledge, unique skills and knowledge, functional expertise.

**core competencies**

Distinguish a firm competitively and reflect its personality,

emerge over time accumulating and learning how to deploy resources and capabilities

Activities ~ performs especially ~ adds unique value to its goods or services

### Four criteria: strategic capabilities <=> competitive advantages

- value <=> valuable capabilities => neutralize threats or exploit opportunities.
- rarity <=> rare capabilities => not possessed by many others
- costly-to-imitate <=> costly to imitate => historical, ambiguous cause, social complexity
- non-substitute <=> non-substitutable => firm-specific, culture, execution

### Primary Activities

inbound logistics (receive, store, inputs to a product)

operations (convert input to product)

outbound logistics (distribute the product to customer)

marketing (sales: induce customers to buy)

service (enhance or maintain product value)

### Support Activities

procurement, technology, human resource(recruit, hire, train, develop, compensate), firm infrastructure, outsource

- Outsourcing is the purchase of a value-creating activity from an external supplier.
- Few organizations possess the resources and capabilities required to achieve competitive superiority in all primary and support activities.
- By performing fewer capabilities:
  - a firm can concentrate on those areas in which it can create value.
  - specialty suppliers can perform outsourced capabilities more efficiently.
- A firm may outsource all or only part of one or more primary and/or support activities.
- Improving business focus helps a firm focus on broader business issues by having outside experts handle various operational details.
- Accelerating re-engineering benefits
- Sharing risks
- Freeing resources for other purposes

**Do Not**

1. Do not outsource activities in which the firm itself can <u>create and capture value</u>.
2. Do not outsource primary and support activities that are used to <u>neutralize environmental threats</u> or to complete necessary ongoing organizational tasks.
3. Do not outsource capabilities <u>critical</u> to the firm’s success, even though the capabilities are not actual sources of competitive advantage.
4. Do not outsource activities that <u>stimulate</u> the development of new capabilities and competencies.

generate inertia and stifle innovation.(产生惯性，扼杀创新)

### Business Level Strategy

**define**

An integrated and coordinated set of commitments and actions the firm uses to <u>gain a competitive advantage by exploiting core competencies</u> in specific product markets.

 (resources and capabilities -> )

core competencies => strategy => business-level-strategy

**three key issues**

Who? What needs? How?

**Who: customers**

All customers = consumer markets + industrial segments

**What: needs**

Related to products benefits/features; neither right nor wrong, good nor bad. Features and performance capabilities.

**How: core competencies necessary to satisfy needs**

Only firms with capacity to continuously improve, innovate and upgrade their competencies.

propose -> differentiate

### Type of business-level strategy

**{Brand v.s. Narrow} Scope**

1. **Cost Leadership v.s. Differentiation**
2. **Focus or not**
3. **Integrated or not**

### Cost leadership

lowest cost relative to other competitors.

- Relatively standardized (commoditized) products
- Features broadly acceptable to many customers
- Lowest competitive price

**to competitors**

rivals hesitate -> greater profit

**to buyers**

driving prices far below competitors -> causing them to exit -> thus shifting power with buyers back to the firm.

**to suppliers**

- absorb cost increases due to low cost position.
- make very large purchases, reducing chance of supplier using power.

**to new entrants**

Frighten off:

- need to enter large scale
- takes time to move down the industry learning curve.

**to substitutes**

- lower prices
- make investment to add features
- buy property and patents

*Risk*

- Processes used to produce and distribute good or service may become obsolete due to competitors’ innovations.
- Too much focus on cost reductions may occur at expense of customers’ perceptions of differentiation.
- Competitors, using their own core competencies, may successfully imitate the cost leader’s strategy.

### Differentiation

being different in ways that are important to them.

- non-standardized products
- Control cost drivers if needed

**to competitors**

loyalty

**to buyers**

Reduce customer sensitivity to pricce increases

**to suppliers**

absort price increase dueto higher margin

Pass along higher prices

**new entrants**

must surpass proven products

at least equal performance with lower prices

**to substitutes**

brand loyalty

*Risk*

- The price differential between the differentiator’s product and the cost leader’s product becomes too large.
- Differentiation ceases to provide value for which customers are willing to pay.
- Experience narrows customers’ perceptions of the value of differentiated features.
- Counterfeit goods replicate the differentiated features of the firm’s products.

### Focus Strategies

serve the needs of a particular competitive segment.

• Focused cost leadership strategy • Focused differentiation strategy

*Risk*

- A focusing firm may be “out focused” by its competitors.
- A large competitor may set its sights on a firm’s niche market.
- Customer preferences in a niche market may change to more closely resemble those of the broader market.

### Integrated Cost Leadership/Didderentiation Strategy

- adapt quickly to environmental changes.
- learn new skills and technologies more quickly.
- effectively leverage its core competencies while competing against its rivals.

necessary:

- Flexible manufacturing systems (FMS) -> computer-controlled
- Information networks (CRM) -> link
- Total quality management (TQM) systems -> continuous improvement

*Risk*

- Often involves compromises: Becoming neither the lowest cost nor the most differentiated firm
- Becoming “stuck in the middle”: Lacking the strong commitment and expertise that accompanies firms following either a cost leadership or a differentiated strategy

### Two strategy levels

- Business level: individual product markets
- Corporate-level: selecte and manage a group of different businesses; compete in different product markets;

### Diversification

**product diversification**: the scope of the industries; buy, create and sell different businesses.

- (low) **Single** business (>95% revenue); dominant business (70%-85% revenue)
- (moderate to high) **related constrained**: <70% from single business and all businesses share prodcut, tech, and distribution. **related linked**: <70% from dominant business and only limited links.
- (very high) **unrelated diversification**: <70% from dominnat business and no common links;

### Reasons for diversification

- Value-creating
  - Economies of scope (related)
    - Sharing activities
    - Transferring core competencies
  - Market power (related)
    - Blocking competitors through multipoint competition
    - Vertical integration
  - Financial economies (unrelated diversification)
    - Efficient internal capital allocation
    - Business restructuring
- Value-Neutral
  - Antitrust regulation
  - Tax laws
  - Low performance
  - Uncertain future cash flows (defensive strategy: product line matrues or is threatened)
  - Risk reduction for firm
  - Tangible resources
  - Intangible resources

### Competitive Dynamics

1. Definitions and Overview
2. Competitor Analysis
3. Drivers of Competitive Behavior
4. Competitive Rivalry
5. Competitive Dynamics

**Definitions**

Competitor are firms operating in the same market, offering similar products, and targeting similar customers.

Competitive Rivalry:

- is the ongoing set of competitive actions and responses occurring between competitors.
- influences an individual firm’s ability to gain and sustain competitive advantages.

**Competitive Dynamics**: The total set of actions and responses taken by all firms competing within a market.

**Success against competitive rivalry**:

1. initial actions
2. anticipate responses
3. anticipate and responds to

Analysis -> Drivers of Behavior -> Rivalry (attack and response) -> outcomes (market positions, financial performance)

- Competitor Analysis

  - Market Commonality
    - Multi market competition (A firm with greater multimarket contact is less likely to initiate an attack, but more likely to respond aggressively when attacked.)
  - Resource Similarity (intangible assets are hard to assess)

- Drivers of Competitive Behavior

  - Awareness (mutual interdependence from market commonality & resource similarity)
  - motivation (incentive to take actions and respond <- perceive gains and losses)
  - Ability (<- resources, attack and repond to attack)
  - Market Commonality (when? attack who?)
  - Resource Dissimilarity (disadvantage -> delay; mush respond eventually)

- Competitive Rivalry

  - Likelihood of Attack

    - First Mover Incentives

    - Second Mover Responds

    - Later Mover Incentives

    - Organizational Size - Small

    - Quality - Product

      Timeliness, courtesy, consistency, convenience, completeness, accuracy

  - Likelihood of Response

    - Type of competitive action
      - Strategic v.s. tactical
    - Actor's reputation
    - Market Dependence
